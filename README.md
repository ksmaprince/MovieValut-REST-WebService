# **Project Title: MovieVault: Movie Collection System**

In the realm of entertainment, the accessibility and management of movie collections have become increasingly integral to user experience. However, existing systems often lack seamless integration and intuitive interfaces, hindering users from efficiently exploring and enjoying their favorite movies. To address this challenge, the proposed project aims to develop a comprehensive movie collection system, that combine the power of Spring Boot as a backend and Android as a frontend.

### MovieVault-WebServices
The primary objective of this project is to create a robust **RESTful API web application** capable of efficiently storing, retrieving, and processing both movie and user information. Leveraging **Spring Boot** for backend development, **Spring Security** for user authentication, and **Spring Data JPA** for data persistence, the system will ensure security, scalability, and reliability in handling diverse user interactions. Furthermore, the project will implement **MySQL** as the backend database, providing a structured foundation for seamless data management. The use of **MySQL** facilitates efficient data organization and retrieval, ensuring optimal performance even with growing user databases.
